🚀 My Kaggle Projects

Hey there! 👋
This is a collection of Kaggle projects I’ve worked on to practice data analysis, machine learning, and feature engineering.

Each project has code, explanations, and datasets, so you can see my approach and how I tackle ML problems.

🏆 Projects
1. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Goal: Predict who survived the Titanic disaster 🛳️

Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, XGBoost classification

Files: titanic_model.py, submission.csv

2. [Upcoming Project]

Goal: Coming soon… 🚀

Techniques: To be added

Files: To be added

💻 How to Run

1.Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/MaheshReddy-ML/Kaggle
cd Kaggle


2.Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost


3. Run a project:
python titanic_model.py

✨ Skills I’m Showing Off
